            This IoT based project is useful at college campuses, hospitals, shopping malls, homes, daycare centers, old age homes, etc, where you can track the real time position of the person. To track the positon of the person, that person should wear the band. This project consist of three parts wearable band, beacon and web api.  For example to track the persons in a college campus, first we have to install beacons in the   were the authorities need to know where the band wearer is, to prevent from any danger and to keep track of the activities. Itâ€™s a common usual band which just have to put on and power it ON and the caretaker will know wherever you go within the Home.

        <li style="font-weight: 600;">Beacon:</li>
        <p>
        Beacon is the device which keep a track of bands. This is stationary device installed in the room. If person wearing the band enters in that room the band sends message to the beacon, after receiving the message, beacon sends the request to cloud server to update the position of the person.

        <li style= "font-weight: 600;">Wearable Band:</li>
       <p>
       This is a small battery powered  device which person can wear on his wrist. When person enters in any room, the band connects to the beacon in that room and sends message to that beacon. After sending the message it goes to the sleep mode for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds it restarts and sends message to beacon. This feature helps to save the battery power. It uses udp protocol for communication between beacon and band.
        </p>
         <li style="font-weight: 600;">Web Api:</li>
        <p>
         Web api is hosted on the heroku platform. We can monitor real time position of the person wearing the band on web browser/mobile app. Beacon sends real time position of the person wearing the band to this web api(application programming interface). After receiving the data this api updates the dashboard where we can graphically monitor the the real time position.Dashboard is easy to use and customize.
